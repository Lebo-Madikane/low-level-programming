POINTERS:
--------

A pointer is a variable which stores a memory address. Everytime we declare a variable, the computer will reserve memory for the variable. The memory reserved will then store the value of the variable.

Depending of the type of variable, the computer will reserve more or less memory. The size of each type is generally defined in bites(1 byte = 8bits, each bit being 0 or 1). The size of the type also depends on the computer you're using. To determine the size of those types on your computer you can use the sizeof operator.

When we ddclare a variable, the computer will reserve the right amount of space for the variable in the memory(depending on its type). The space reserved for the variable is its address. And when we assign a value to the variable, the computer will store the value at its address. 

In order to know what is the address of the variable, you can use the "address-of unary operator" &.
