About Structures
----------------
A struct (or structure) is a collection of variables (can be of different types) under a single name.

Suppose you want to store information about a person: his/her name, citizenship number, and salary. You can create different variables name, citNo and salary to store this information.

What if you need to store information of more than one person? Now, you need to create different variables for each information per person: name1, citNo1, salary1, name2, citNo2, salary2, etc.

A better approach would be to have a collection of all related information under a single name Person structure and use it for every person.
